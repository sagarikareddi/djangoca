This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).



# PROFNET

This project is a web application built with a variety of technologies including Next.js, GSAP Animations, and Django REST API.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: The frontend of this application is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

- **Animations**: We use [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth, professional-grade animations.

- **Backend**: The backend is powered by [Django REST API](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Start the server on https://localhost:3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
